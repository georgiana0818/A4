/*
Question 9)Do the same as question 1.7 but this time only include trunks that
have at least one 'IDLE' channel. That is, write an SQL query
that will produce in one table a list of all the acceptable trunks 
that can be used to route a call to the 416 area code, 
office code 334 have at least one idle channel. 
This query should list the trunks in the order of preference. 
(The answer should list trunks routes 416,334 then 416,000 then 000,000 for example)
